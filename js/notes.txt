TODO menu:



1- GenerateDamage to ramp function (need collision count for ramp, after 3 hits ramp disappears)

2- Collision boolean function (for ramp and targets)

3- create target object (easy)

4- create collision route for blob (function in the blob class object, create boolean variable which when true 
initiates the collision script, interrupts the normal update and run a different route)
If too slow, can try to draw imaginary line between extremities of ramp, then test collision in gameState.js
** do like the asteroid game, create an array with all the points**

5- create a transparent line with mouse click that linkes to where user is dragging to








Notes:
